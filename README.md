# 🧠 Simon Says Game

A fun and interactive memory game inspired by the classic "Simon Says"!  
Test your memory by repeating an ever-growing sequence of colors and sounds. With each correct turn, the sequence gets longer — how far can you go?

## 🎮 Basic Rules

1. **Watch the Pattern**  
   The game will flash a sequence of colors. Pay close attention!

2. **Repeat the Sequence**  
   Click the colors in the exact order they appeared.

3. **Level Up**  
   Each time you correctly repeat the sequence, a new color is added, and the game gets harder.

4. **Make a Mistake**  
   If you click the wrong color, the game ends.

5. **Try Again**  
   Restart the game and challenge yourself to beat your high score!
